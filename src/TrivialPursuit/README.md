# Trivial Pursuit

This Kata is inspired of [Johan Martinsson](https://twitter.com/johan_alps)'s [BugsZero Kata](https://github.com/martinsson/BugsZero-Kata). The actual codebase implements a slightly modified [Trivial Pursuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit) game.

Now the winner is not anymore the first player to reach 6 points, but the first player to have at least 4 points and 2 points more than any other player.

Your task is to implement this new feature.
